# v1.2.12 - 2025-12-22

## Performance

### Non-blocking update check

The update check is now performed asynchronously in the background, eliminating startup delays.

**What's New**:

- Removed blocking HTTP call to GitHub API from `buildLongDescription()`
- Added `CheckForUpdatesAsync()` function that runs in a goroutine
- Update notification appears at the end of execution (if available)

**Impact**: Startup time is no longer affected by network latency or GitHub API response time. Previously, slow network conditions could add up to 5 seconds of delay before the tool started.
