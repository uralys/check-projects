# v1.2.11 - 2025-12-22

## Features

### Configurable fetch concurrency

Added a new `fetch_concurrency` option to control the number of parallel git fetches.

**What's New**:

- New `fetch_concurrency` config option (default: 10)
- Fetches run in a worker pool pattern for smooth parallelism
- No more waiting for batches - new fetches start as soon as a slot is free

**Configuration**:

```yaml
fetch: true
fetch_concurrency: 30  # Run up to 30 fetches in parallel
```

**Impact**: Faster fetch operations when using `-f` flag, especially with many repositories.
